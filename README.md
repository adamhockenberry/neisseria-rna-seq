# neisseria-rna-seq

This repository includes all the code used in a forthcoming manuscript analyzing the transcriptome response of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to oxidative challenge. 

Currently, this repository is a work-in-progress during manuscript preparation/submission and will subsequently be cleaned to remove extraneous information and to include explicit instructions with regard to repeating any computational analyses that appear in the final manuscript. 

For the code to run properly, users are required to create two separate folders in this home directory that are not currently included as part of the repository: `Data/` and `Results/` 

These directories are currently ommitted for size constraints but explicit instructions where to find the data required to perform the analysis will be updated upon manuscript publication. 

In the meantime, any questions should be directed to the repository owner.
